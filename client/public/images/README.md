## Prompt

Photorealistic hero-image prompt

A sleek, chrome-and-glass humanoid robot sits at an oak writer’s desk in a softly lit creative studio. Blue electrical filaments arc from ports along its back into a glowing book manuscript it is “writing” on a digital paper tablet that rests atop a stack of freshly printed hard-cover books. Nearby, holographic pages float in mid-air, morphing into vibrant illustrated spreads before folding themselves into PDF icons that shimmer above the desk. In the background, tall bookshelves display finished, custom-branded titles, hinting at limitless personalization. Shallow depth-of-field, cinematic lighting, 8-K resolution, photorealism.

How this prompt sells your service
Robot authoring → the humanoid robot represents your AI agents “acting as book authors.”

Electricity & holograms → visualizes the high-tech, real-time creation process.

Stack of printed books + PDF icons → shows both the physical and digital outputs you deliver.

Photorealistic, cinematic style → feels premium and trustworthy for a website hero section.

Feel free to tweak brand colors (e.g., change the arc-light hue to your company palette) or aspect ratio (16:9 for a hero banner, 1:1 for social posts).



A friendly, chrome-and-white humanoid robot—rendered in a clean, semi-flat cartoon style—sits at a pale-oak writer’s desk bathed in bright, airy light. Soft gradients of white and sky-blue wash over the scene, giving everything a fresh, high-key glow. Gentle turquoise energy strands arc from ports along the robot’s back into a luminous digital-paper tablet, where it “writes” a sparkling manuscript perched atop a neat stack of crisp hard-cover books trimmed in pastel blues. Around the desk, translucent holographic pages hover playfully, flipping into vivid illustrated spreads before folding into gleaming PDF icons outlined in light blue. Behind the robot, minimalist white bookshelves dotted with pastel-accent spines showcase finished, custom-branded titles, hinting at endless personalization. Use shallow depth-of-field and bright cartoon shading to keep the focus on the robot and its creative tools while maintaining a modern, website-friendly aesthetic at high resolution.

A sleek chrome-and-glass humanoid robot, softly back-lit, stands at the front of a modern creative studio that doubles as a classroom. It points a glowing stylus toward a large, transparent holographic screen floating beside an oak desk. On the screen, vivid step-by-step UI panels of the “Booker” app animate—chapter outlines transform into illustrated pages, then fold into shimmering PDF icons—while arcs of blue energy link the robot’s fingertips to the interface. Seated at the desk, a curious human learner observes, illuminated by the screen’s bluish glow, with a digital-paper tablet open and ready. Stacks of freshly printed, custom-branded hard-cover books and floating holographic bookmarks surround them, hinting at limitless personalization. Shallow depth of field, cinematic rim lighting, studio haze for atmosphere, extreme realism.
